# Supply-Chain-Data-Cleaning-Relational-Modeling
A data preparation and modeling project that cleans and normalizes a supply chain dataset. The project converts a single denormalized CSV into eight relational tables using Python and loads them into PostgreSQL, creating a SQL-ready foundation for downstream supply chain analytics and logistics strategy.
